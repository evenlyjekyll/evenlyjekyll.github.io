## Building the website locally
### Prerequisites
You need to install the static site generator [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

To install run `gem install jekyll` in the terminal. If that fails run `gem update` and try again.

### Running the website locally
Go to the folder in Terminal where you cloned the repository (see above).

`jekyll build` creates the site from the template files.

`jekyll serve` allows you to try the page locally in your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000)

## Image Specs
The path for images used on the site is `/images` and project images live in another level, named after the project, in lowercase (example `/images/3daround`).

Images are different for some breakpoints; details below.

### Home

#### Carousel

Carousel images are fused with device images for launch. That will be changed later. For now, these are the dimensions in which images should be exported. Ox will take care of producing the usable assets.

For launch, this needs to be rendered with a circle shaped mask, as a transparent PNG. Later we should fix that to use HTML.
