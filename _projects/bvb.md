description:   |
    We took over the development of the Borussia Dortmund app from our friends at [Rheinfabrik](http://www.rheinfabrik.de) on behalf of [SPORTFIVE](http://www.sportfive.de).
    
    The BVB app encompasses all the features a fan could wish for: play schedule, live ticker and push notification, player and team infos as well as posts from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. On a match day the app transforms into a realtime stream with detailed up to the minute infos, texts, videos and images.
    
    The app is designed by our partners at [Silberpuls](http://silberpuls.de) and built with love for Android and iOS.
