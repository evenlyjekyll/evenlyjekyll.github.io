    [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com) is one of the biggest places for sharing music and sounds on the web.
    
    Since 2008 nxtbgthng supported SoundCloud in the development of the official SoundCloud app for iPhone and iPad. We built the app from the ground up and helped build the iPad user interface that was launched in the fall of 2011. At the end of 2012 development was handed over to SoundCloud's internal team.
    
    In addition we built and supported the SoundCloud API wrapper for Cocoa touch, that is used by hundreds of developers to built upon the SoundCloud API. Of course the official SoundCloud app is built upon this library.
