  Together with [Studio GOOD](http://www.studio-good.de) we concepted, designed and built a tablet magazine for ARTE to promote the great cultural content available on ARTE. In addition to the app we also built a backend for letting the editors create the beautiful multimedia issues that make up Culture Touch.

   Culture Touch brings you the latest in culture as seen on ARTE in a digital weekly magazine. Every Friday, Culture Touch features a selection of the most interesting exhibitions, shows, films, books, albums and events to keep you up to date with the most interesting cultural gems.

   Enjoy!
